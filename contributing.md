# Contributing to XboxDVR


OpenXBL is a community driven project and accepts contributions of code and documentation from the community. These contributions are made in the form of Issues or [Pull Requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) on the [XboxDVR repository](https://github.com/OpenXBL/XboxDVR) on GitHub.

Issues are a quick way to point out a bug. If you find a bug or documentation error in XboxDVR then please check a few things first:

1. There is not already an open Issue
2. The issue has already been fixed (check the develop branch, or look for closed Issues)
3. Is it something really obvious that you can fix yourself?

Reporting issues is helpful but an even better approach is to send a Pull Request, which is done by "Forking" the main repository and committing to your own copy. This will require you to use the version control system called Git.
